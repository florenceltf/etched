body: "When a site is zoned mixed use, the response is to build residences  \nor commercial
  tenancies or some proportion of each type – this project allows for both uses to
  occur in the same space. A “flexible space”, complete with bathroom, kitchenette
  and storage is ready to accommodate a creative studio, a shop, an extension of the
  living area or even a car.\n\nThe functional integrity of the project is its flexible
  spaces, they allow for multiple scenarios of work, live and socialising in the same
  space. The ground and first floor flexible spaces are ready to accommodate a creative
  studio, a shop, or extension of the living area."
