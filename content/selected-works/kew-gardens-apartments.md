  When a site is zoned mixed use, the response is to build residences or commercial tenancies or some proportion of each type – this project allows for both uses to occur in the same space. A “flexible space”, complete with bathroom, kitchenette and storage is ready to accommodate a creative studio, a shop, an extension of the living area or even a car.

  The functional integrity of the project is its flexible spaces, they allow for multiple scenarios of work, live and socialising in the same space. The ground and first floor flexible spaces are ready to accommodate a creative studio, a shop, or extension of the living area.
