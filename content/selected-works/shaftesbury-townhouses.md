  On a quiet street in Thornbury, four dwellings appear from the streetscape as one home—subverting the vernacular of a multi-residential development.

  The front garden becomes a key focus—as though it’s playing the role the backyard usually would, with its generous sense of space.

  Maximising individual gardens, landscape design draws on verticality—with _Parthonicissus_ combining with the high timber pergolas, to create a composition with new and existing trees.
