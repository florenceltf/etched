body: "The heritage façade immediately sets the tone for the landscape throughout
  these five dwellings.  \n  \nWhile all residences share access to a common courtyard,
  each home has its own sense of escape through a private walled garden.  \n  \nThe
  landscape was fundamental to delineating the entrance point with the introduction
  of a central canopy tree—connecting the established architecture of the site, with
  its new built form."
