  On a tightly held block on busy St Georges Road, the challenge was to do more, with less.

  This called for plants with characteristics that can be integrated with the architecture—landscaping that frames outdoor zones rather than dominating the spaces.

  While reorientating the site off the bustling street front, we considered what it would contribute to both the public realm, and its private residences.
