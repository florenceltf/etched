  For Wilson Avenue Brunswick, Neometro and Milieu are creating a precinct within a suburb.

  Intentionally blurring the lines between the public realm and traditional property boundaries, the landscape at the entrance feels like both a civic gesture, and a private access point to the building.

  Layers and groupings of plants have been incorporated across two raised planter zones to create a distinct entrance moment.
