body: |-
  A rooftop garden at Lygon Street East Brunswick elevates the experience of communal living, with a shared space for all residents to take in the district views.

  At the front entry, a landscaped forecourt creates a point of interest, while being empathetic to the old bluestone façade of the neighbouring property.
