Etched creates responsive, enduring works of landscape architecture, that cultivate connections between people and their environments.

We believe that spaces of green are more than a means to soften harsh edges and angular lines. They’re a place of calm in an otherwise kinetic life. A lens to capture northern light.

They surprise us— shifting and evolving with the seasons. They evoke the imagination. They’re a complex tapestry of colour, texture, form and materiality.

We understand that outcomes like this are the result of a shared and collaborative journey between our team, and our network of designers and makers. They care as much as we do. And for that reason, our places feel different.

With every detail a binding thread in a larger story, our places are etched in time.
