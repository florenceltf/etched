story: "Etched creates responsive, enduring works of landscape architecture, that cultivate
  connections between people and their environments.\n\nWe believe that spaces of
  green are more than a means to soften harsh edges and angular lines. They’re a place
  of calm in an otherwise kinetic life. A lens to capture northern light.\n\nThey
  surprise us — shifting and evolving with the seasons. They evoke the imagination.
  They’re a complex tapestry of colour, texture, form and materiality.\n\n![/images/uploads/example07.jpg](https://app.forestry.io/sites/l0cbg2rjvsn3na/body-media//images/uploads/example07.jpg)\n\nWe
  understand that outcomes like this are the result of a shared and collaborative
  journey between our team, and our network of designers and makers. They care as
  much as we do. And for that reason, our places feel different.\n\n![/images/uploads/example08.jpg](https://app.forestry.io/sites/l0cbg2rjvsn3na/body-media//images/uploads/example08.jpg)\n\nWith
  every detail a binding thread in a larger story, our places are etched in time."
